We don't "compete" with the following data sources
Many specialized data sources are valuable
We source the data and then organize it to work with graph technology
The starting point for graph technology is:
  identity (X isA Y)
  organizing data
then - relationships
  A isUsedToImprove B
then - queries
  looking at similar and different data across studies
  that's what is happening here for glucosinolates and brassica
  https://wedge.ontomatica.io/Glucosinolates-Research_-_19-09-06/Wedge
then - reasoning
  discovering new information about X and B

Our value-add is the organization of information from different sources and different formats
Once organized, we can connect the dots

You don't want to look too closely at the following resoures as each presents excessive detail
But if you "sample" the resources (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)) a high level perspective may trigger Story-based ideas

Having said that, if you want to feature any of the items below (to support your Story-line), we can repeat them in an Attachment or link to the site.

Finally, we'll want to "reproduce" your process for Wheat
Per earlier email, our Wheat data is 10-100x greater than Rice
We need to deflate Wheat so the "baloon size" for Rice and Wheat is comparable
It's perfectly fine that they are very similar
